# Write a simple program that:

# 1. Prints out "What is the original price?"
#    Read the user's input.
#    and converts the user's input into a decimal/float.






# 2. Prints out "How many percent of discount is offered?"
#    Read the user's input.
#    and converts the user's input into a decimal/float.







# 3. Calculate the final price after the discount, 
#    and prints out "The final price after the discount is ______."
#    depending on the previous inputs.












# Hint:
# Some example results include:

#     original | discount | final
#  ------------|----------|--------
#     300.0    |    10    |  270.0 
#     300.0    |    20    |  240.0 
#     500.0    |     0    |  500.0 
#     500.0    |    30    |  350.0 
#   10000.0    |    20    | 8000.0 
#    3000.0    |    25    | 2250.0
